    <section class="story-body">
        <p class="body-text serif">Heat pumps, unassuming home appliances that can both heat and cool homes, have quickly become the talk of the town in the world of clean energy.</p> 
        <p class="body-text serif"><a href="https://twitter.com/leahstokes/status/1598718635983310848?s=20" target="_blank">Scholars</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/leahstokes/status/1598718635983310848?s=20" target="_blank">advocates</a> alike sing their praises as the future of sustainable heating, while fossil fuel companies <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/02/07/maine-gas-industry-heat-pumps/" target="_blank">launch campaigns</a> to sway people away from them. As the momentum of heat pump adoption grows in various states, New York State lags far behind despite the potential benefits of reduced emissions.</p>

        <h3 class="section-head">What are heat pumps, anyway?</h3>
        <p class="body-text serif">Simply put, a heat pump is an air conditioner that can double as a heater during the winter months.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Just like traditional ACs, heat pumps also run on electricity. What makes clean energy supporters so excited about heat pumps is not just that they can replace fossil fuel heating systems like gas and oil furnaces with electrically powered ones. The unique way heat pumps work makes them incredibly energy efficient, which ultimately helps with reducing greenhouse gas emissions from buildings.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Unlike fossil fuel boilers, heat pumps do not generate heat from a fuel source. Instead, they move heat energy in and out of a home through the use of refrigerants. During the summertime, heat pumps gather heat from inside and push it outdoors, making houses cool and dehumidified. Again, think of a chilled room with an AC unit on a hot summer day.</p>

        <img src="cooling.png" style="width: 100%"></img>

        <p class="body-text serif">In the winter, the direction of that movement flips around— Heat pumps take heat from outside to inside to warm a home. This may sound counterintuitive. After all, how can it bring heat into a house when it is 10 degrees outside?</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">This is because heat, at the end of the day, is just energy moving around in the air, and even in cold weather, there is enough energy to heat the refrigerant that is even colder. Heat pump refrigerants with low boiling temperatures get warmed up outside, and go through a compressor, becoming hot enough to warm a home.</p>

        <h3 class="section-head">Why is it good for the climate?</h3>

        <p class="body-text serif">This seemingly humdrum home appliance has gained a surprising amount of attention over the past several years thanks to its remarkable efficiency and promising potential to address climate concerns. </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">For much of the world, heating homes is a carbon-intensive process. According to <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-heat-pumps/executive-summary" target="_blank">the 2022 report by International Energy Agency (IEA)</a>, heating in buildings is responsible for 10 percent of global emissions today. It estimated that “heat pumps have the potential to reduce global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by at least 500 million tonnes in 2030—equal to the annual CO2 emissions of all cars in Europe today.”</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">The benefit of heat pumps goes beyond the heating season. The astonishing efficiency and cost-saving potential makes them appealing for many consumers with cooling needs who are looking to replace their old air conditioners.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">“Much like solar, batteries, and electric vehicles, heat pumps have gotten remarkably better in the last 10 years,” said Sam Calisch, the head of Special Projects at Rewiring America, a nonprofit organization advocating electrification in homes.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">“When we talk about replacing an air conditioner with a heat pump, usually what we mean is replacing an older air conditioner with a newer air conditioner that can also do heat.”</p>  
        
        <img src="shipments.png" style="width: 100%"></img>    

        <p class="body-text serif">More consumers are hopping onto the heat pump trend. The IEA report showed that global heat pump market sales rose nearly 15 percent in 2021, double the average of the past decade. The rise was most pronounced in European Union countries, where rising natural gas prices pushed customers to explore new ways to heat their homes. The United States also saw record-high sales in 2021, with 3.9 million heat pumps shipped across the country.</p>

        <h3 class="section-head">What does this mean for New York?</h3>

        <p class="body-text serif">Despite the increasing adoption on a national scale, individual states widely differ in the current state of heat pump expansion. According to the Residential Energy Consumption Survey by U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), around 3 percent of New York State residents use heat pumps for heating, significantly fewer than in other states with available data.</p>

    <section class="story-body">        
        <p class="body-text serif">The low number does not capture the environmental benefit New York can reap from widespread transition to heat pumps. The energy efficiency of heat pumps makes them especially useful for New York City, where 70 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions are from buildings. This makes the decarbonization of buildings critical for the city’s efforts to go green.</p>

        <img src="nyc_ghg.png" style="width: 100%"></img>

        <p class="body-text serif">However, New York City’s high renter population and unique heating regulations make it less than ideal for residents to switch to heat pumps. Many rental agreements in NYC include gas or steam heating bills as part of rent, but exclude electricity usage. This means that renters who choose to move to electrical heating may have to pay more.</p>

        <p class="body-text serif">For example, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) has <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdfs/services/hpd-tenant-paid-heat-policy.pdf" target="_blank">released a guideline for developers</a> around installing heat pumps, to protect residents from paying higher utility bills. It requires HPD permission for any heat pump installations in affordable housing units, and does not allow resident-paid heat for buildings with a large share of vulnerable residents. For approved heat pump installations, owners must restructure rent so that it takes into account the potential increase in heating costs.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">“It’s a huge challenge.” sad Calisch, acknowledging that the city cannot depend on a few climate-concerned renters for a city-wide change. “We need to make sure that the building owners know that there are options for whole-building heating that are electrified, which in many cases can also save them money.”</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">In August 2022, New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayr Aric Adams <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-and-mayor-adams-announce-70-million-initial-investment-decarbonize-nycha" target="_blank">announced a $70 million investment</a> to install 30,000 heat pumps in the city’s public housing facilities. The initiative is part of the state’s “Clean Heart for All” challenge, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings by 40 percent before 2030.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Calisch said that speed is critical to maximizing the emissions reduction. “Every single new machine we install that runs on fossil fuels is locking in that consumption for the next ten to 20 years,” he said. “What we absolutely cannot do is wait to electrify.”</p>
