        <p class="body-text serif">On Aug. 13,  2003, at about 4:10 p.m., New York City went into darkness. </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">All electricity was shut off after a tree branch hit the power line, causing an unprecedented 31-hour-long blackout that affected an estimated 45 million throughout the Northeast. Hospitals strained with an influx of patients amid a sweltering 90-degree summer heat. Riders were stranded in subway trains for hours with no air-conditioning. Almost a decade later, researchers found that nearly a hundred people died in the city due to the 2003 power outage. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">While such major blackouts remain a rare event in New York, even small-scale outages present palpable threats to some. For people who use electric medical equipment such as nebulizers or oxygen concentrators, an hours-long outage may result in a visit to the emergency room or hospitalization.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">As the number of New Yorkers relying on electric medical equipment grew significantly over the past few years, so has the threat of more frequent outages driven by extreme weather events and climate change. This makes power outages a greater public health risk for New Yorkers and beyond.</p>

        <p class="body-text serif">A record number of Medicare recipients in New York City currently depend on electric medical equipment to breathe, move, and survive. According to the data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, more than 36,000 recipients used electric medical equipment as of August 2022. This was a 44 percent increase from 2016 when the data was first collected. However, this likely undercounts the true number of people since the data only include those on Medicare. </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Electric medical equipment, often referred to as electric durable medical equipment (DME), can range from oxygen concentrators, nebulizers, electric wheelchairs, bed lifts, and more. Many use them in their homes to help with preexisting conditions such as asthma.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">“It’s the homebound folks who can't leave their apartments we’re most concerned about,” said Sarah Johnson, the director of the Air Quality Program at the New York City Department of Health. Unlike those at hospitals and nursing homes, which often have backup generators, “their power source for their electric medical equipment would be cut off,” she explained.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Consequently, the users of electric DMEs are often the most distressed and vocal during power outages. Con Edison’s Twitter account is strewn with desperate calls for help.</p>

        <p class="body-text serif">Professor Joan Casey, Assistant Professor at the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University, has studied the health impact of power outages for years. But the issue was brought close to home recently when her two-year-old daughter had to use a nebulizer for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) treatment.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">“If the power had gone out, we would have had to go to the emergency room,” Casey said. “The power going out on some people can take it from being in your home in a safe environment to extremely life-threatening really, really quickly.” </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Casey explained that the health impact of power outages may be felt harder in certain neighborhoods. The historic disinvestment in infrastructure adds to the reasons why these neighborhoods might get left behind in restoration efforts. Utility companies like Con Edison focus on critical infrastructures such as hospitals and nursing homes during outages. The lack of such vital facilities put certain communities at a lower priority when it comes to distributing crews. </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Compounded with other environmental factors such as low tree covering and heat-island effects, power outages in these neighborhoods can be especially dangerous. “The built environment absolutely can exacerbate a power outage's effects on health,” Casey added. </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Neighborhoods with the highest number of electric medical equipment users are also likely to have higher poverty rates. This may be due to a higher prevalence of respiratory diseases in low-income households. Nationwide, lower-income and less educated adults reported more respiratory symptoms in all surveys between 1959 and 2018, according to a 2021 article published in the Journal of American Medical Association. A similar trend holds true in New York City, where “high-poverty neighborhoods have the highest burden of asthma-related morbidity.”</p>

        <!-- CHART 2 -->
        <iframe title="Poorer neighborhoods in NYC tend to rely more on electric medical equipment." aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-zxBmR" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zxBmR/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="520" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>

        <p class="body-text serif">Despite the risk, lower-income residents tend to be less prepared when an outage happens. “It's very hard to stock up on things when you are just managing to make it through every day,” Johnson said. “The likelihood of power outages is relatively rare. If you're deciding what you're going to put your energy into, it seems to make sense that that kind of falls lower on the priority.”</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">A phone survey conducted by the New York City Department of Health showed that, among the 857 respondents, only 58 percent had essential equipment prepared in case of an outage. A related report found that at-risk groups were more likely to live in multi-family buildings, making it more challenging to access medical assistance and drinking water, especially if they live on higher floors or have difficulties leaving their units due to health issues. </p>

        <p class="body-text serif">Besides homebound patients, low-income communities and communities of color also tend to be more vulnerable when responding to power outages. Though some places may have backup power during blackouts, these communities “may hesitate to approach something like a police station or something that makes them uncomfortable,” Johnson said. She added that the city’s health department has been supporting local organizations to develop a volunteer network, which would check on vulnerable communities during a heatwave or power outages.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">”We don't want to cause people more stress than they already are experiencing,” she explained,  “so it means cultivating community-based outreach, or a safety net.”</p>

        <p class="body-text serif">Experts agree that as the planet warms, extreme weather will test the stability of the energy infrastructure in the city. “Climate change is absolutely going to make these disparities worse,” said Columbia professor Joan Casey, explaining that more than 50 percent of all outages in New York State are tied to weather events. </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">“Unless we fix our grid, we're going to see more power outages as we see increases in storms. I don't anticipate this problem going away anytime soon. Unfortunately,” she added. </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Mounting pressures on the electrical grid comes at a time when more of America’s infrastructure transitions to cleaner electricity. More electric vehicles, electric heating systems, and induction stovetops mean more reliance on a stable power supply and a higher contingency for service disruptions.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">In addition, city dwellers may face greater challenges during outages compared to residents in other regions. “In places like New York City, it's really a problem because a lot of people can’t purchase a generator if you live in a highrise,” Casey explained.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">How should New Yorkers stay prepared when a blackout occurs? The Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends the general public build an emergency kit. The kit includes a working flashlight, a three-day supply of food that would not spoil, and drinking water. Residents could also sign up for outage notifications from their utility providers, which helps them react to outages in advance.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Besides having water, food supplies, and other essentials, Casey recommended at-risk groups to prepare backup batteries for electric medical devices “as much as possible.” In addition, they should discuss with their medical providers to come up with an emergency plan, which entails where and how patients can get reliable access to medical support.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">“But it is a very difficult situation that I think we mostly haven't dealt with, from an infrastructure perspective.” Casey added, “Because the reality is, if you rely on DME—you need access to electricity.”</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">In 1984, then New York City Mayor Ed Koch brought a $123 million class action lawsuit against Con Edison, alleging the utility company of gross negligence during a 25-hour-long citywide outage in 1977. The court ultimately held Con Edison responsible for direct injuries resulting from the blackout, yet not liable for other damages such as costs for additional staffing in hospitals. </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Some advocates and experts have been citing Con Edison’s investor-owned utility business model as the cause of frequent blackouts and lack of efficient responses. </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">“[Con Edison’s] current tariff structure is such that they make a regulated profit margin on the unit of investment,” said Professor Yury Dvorkin, Associate Professor at John Hopkins University, whose research focuses on emerging smart grid technologies. “What could force Con Edison to be more efficient, in terms of increasing the reliability of their energy delivery services, is to make sure that reliability of that supply is part of the tariff.” </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">In October 2020, Dvorkin led a team at New York University to collect real-time outage data and quantify electricity vulnerability among New York City residents. The team now works with the city’s health department, using this data to notify restaurants to reduce the risk of foodborne illness.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">“[Con Edison] needs to use this data to also better understand their customers, and what their electricity vulnerabilities are,” Dvorkin said, “to make sure that electricity consumers are properly taken care of.”</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">In addition to improvements on Con Edison’s part, health experts recommend that the city needs to upgrade its energy and preparedness resources to better respond to outages. </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Casey suggested that “solar panels on rooftops and battery storage in the building” would make communities more resilient to big power outages. “In the event that the larger grid goes out, you can have backup power,” she said.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">The lack of clear information is also part of the underlying issue. For one, the number of health incidents caused by power outages may be undercounted. “Certain groups may not go to the hospital because of lack of insurance. So it's difficult to count the health outcomes that are linked to power outages,” Casey said. “There's not that much information yet, basically.”</p>
